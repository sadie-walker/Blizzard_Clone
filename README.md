# Blizzard_Clone

*Please Note: this site was developed prior to the accusations made against Activision Blizzard. 
I'm horrifed by the way the employees have been treated and in no way do the views of the company align with my values.
I'm sorry for any offence caused by my continued use of this site.*

A clone of the Activision Blizzard homepage as at June 2021 using HTML, SASS & JavaScript. 

I chose to clone the Blizzard website as I felt it had some challenging components such as: carousels, drop-down menus and mobile navigation. 
From creating this site I have learnt a lot about styling a larger (than previous project) application,
for example the importance of specificity, knock-on effects of styling, how useful before & afters can be and z-index hierarchy.
